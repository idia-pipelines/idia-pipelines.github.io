          <h1 id="calibration">Calibration</h1>

<p>Our algorithmic approach toward calibration in the pipeline can be found <a href="/docs/processMeerKAT/calibration-in-processmeerkat">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stokes-i-calibration-continuum">Stokes I Calibration (Continuum)</h3>

<p>Stokes I calibration is achieved in <code class="highlighter-rouge">xx_yy_solve.py</code>, and includes standard delay, bandpass and gain calibration. Within this pipeline, this is done to obtain better statistics for a second round of flagging.</p>

<p>Stokes I calibration is the default mode of the pipeline, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xx_yy_solve.py</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">xx_yy_apply.py</code> scripts, instead of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xy_yx_solve.py</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">xy_yx_apply.py</code> scripts. Since the 2nd round of flagging is different to the 1st, and much more effective, these two scripts are called twice, in a second round that should not be skipped. Furthermore, for good calibration, new solutions should always be derived after flagging.</p>

<!-- Krishna to revise -->
<!-- Lastly, it is recommended the 'xy_yx' scripts be run anyway, since linear feeds tend to have non-negligible coupling between the feeds, and so even to get a good Stokes I image, full Stokes calibration may be required.

Therefore, for Stokes I calibration, the 'xy_yx' scripts may be replaced with the 'xx_yy' scripts, in which case only a minimal speedup will be gained. Therefore, this use case is generally discouraged. One reason for this use case may be where issues arise with the calibration, and to simplify the processing to what is well understood. -->

<h5 id="short-track-observations-and-fluxscale-issues">Short-Track Observations and Fluxscale Issues</h5>

<p>Replacing the ‘xy_yx’ scripts with the ‘xx_yy’ scripts is recommended for short-track observations (e.g. 2 hours), because the ‘xy_yx’ scripts assume that the phase calibrator has sufficient parallactic angle coverage to solve for the leakage and Stokes Q &amp; U. We also recommend this for cases where there are issues with fluxscale, which often occurs when the ‘xy_yx’ scripts are run for short-track observations. **New in v1.1: Only <code class="highlighter-rouge">xx_yy</code> scripts are used by default, and if the parallactic angle coverage is &lt; 30 degrees, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dopol</code> will be forced to False, meaning the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xy_yx</code> scripts will not be inserted, even if the user chooses to perform polarisation calibration.</p>

<h3 id="full-stokes-calibration-polarisation">Full Stokes Calibration (Polarisation)</h3>

<p>Full Stokes calibration can be activated with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[-P --dopol]</code>, which, in addition to the calibration listed <a href="#stokes-i-calibration-continuum">above</a>, includes calibration of instrumental leakage, X-Y phase, source polarisation, and Stokes Q and U from gain variations, using the CASA helper task <code class="highlighter-rouge">GainFromQU</code>. This is achieved by using the phase calibrator to solve as a function of parallactic angle.</p>

<p>Currently the pipeline does not solve for absolute polarisation angle, since the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CALIBRATE_POLARIZATION</code> intent is missing from MeerKAT datasets. Additionally, CASA currently has no functionality to solve for wide-band leakage and QU, but assumes a constant value across single spectral windows. Both of these issues will be addressed in future releases.</p>

<p>Full-Stokes calibration is not recommended for short-track observations (see <a href="#short-track-observations-and-fluxscale-issues">section above</a>).</p>

<h3 id="calibrating-a-small-sub-band-spectral-line">Calibrating a Small Sub-Band (Spectral Line)</h3>

<p>A small sub-band of frequencies can be selected and calibrated by specifying a range of frequencies with argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">spw</code> in your config file. e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">spw = '0:1350~1450MHz'</code> means <code class="highlighter-rouge">partition</code> will extract only frequencies between 1350-1450 MHz for calibration. For very small bandwidth of several MHz, it may not be necessary to use MMS and MPI (see section <a href="#ms-only-single-thread-processing">MS only</a> below).</p>

<p>This mode is useful for calibration of spectral line data.</p>

<h1 id="data-format">Data Format</h1>

<h3 id="default-ms---mms">Default: MS -&gt; MMS</h3>

<p>By default, the pipeline will convert the input measurement set (MS) into a multi-measurement set (MMS), partitioning the data by scan, such that the number of sub-MSs making up the MMS is equal to the number of scans. The input MS does not need to be copied to your working directory, since <code class="highlighter-rouge">partition.py</code> needs only to read the input data (e.g. from <code class="highlighter-rouge">/idia/projects/</code>).</p>

<p>At the end of the pipeline, <code class="highlighter-rouge">split.py</code> will split each of the field IDs specified in your config file into MMS format. This is the default behaviour, since the default value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">keepmms</code> in the config file is <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>. This also ensures <code class="highlighter-rouge">tclean</code> makes use of MPI (and multiple CPUs) during <code class="highlighter-rouge">quick_tclean.py</code>, so that your imaging runs much more quickly.</p>

<p>This mode is encouraged for users who only want to have quicklook images, or who have written a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tclean</code> script that will make use of MPI, that they can insert at the end of the pipeline (see <a href="/docs/processMeerKAT/using-the-pipeline#inserting-your-own-scripts">Using the Pipeline</a>).</p>

<h3 id="ms---mms---ms">MS -&gt; MMS -&gt; MS</h3>

<p>When setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">keepmms=False</code> in your config file, the pipeline will convert your data to MMS as usual, but during running <code class="highlighter-rouge">split</code>, each of the field IDs specified in your config file will be written in MS format. By default, <code class="highlighter-rouge">quick_tclean.py</code> will still run, and will make use of multiple CPUs, but not MPI, meaning your imaging will run slower. However, this step (and the subsequent plotting step) can be skipped by removing them from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scripts</code> parameter in your config file. This general mode of processing is encouraged when the user wishes to do their own imaging that requires an MS.</p>

<h3 id="ms-only-single-thread-processing">MS only (single thread processing)</h3>

<p>The pipeline can be run on a MS, where the user would have to request 1 node and 1 task per node. In this case, the user would set <code class="highlighter-rouge">createmms=False</code> in their config.</p>

<p>This mode isn’t generally encouraged, but may be useful for small datasets (tens of GB - e.g. small bandwidth of several MHz, or short-track observations), when using MMS has little to no advantage, or when the number of scans is very large (hundreds), when splitting into multiple SPWs and multiple sub-MSs is too extreme.</p>

<h1 id="field-ids">Field IDs</h1>

<h3 id="default-primary-and-secondary-calibrator">Default: Primary and Secondary Calibrator</h3>

<p>A standard observation will have a primary calibrator (e.g. J1939-6342 or J0408-6545), which is both the bandpass and total flux calibrator, and a secondary calibrator, which is the phase calibrator (and is also used for polarisation calibration).</p>

<h3 id="single-calibrator-and-target">Single calibrator and target</h3>

<p>In rare cases, a primary calibrator may be close enough to the target(s) that only one calibrator is used throughout the observation. This use case is supported, but caution must be used to ensure the correct flux scale.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-calibrator-field-ids">Multiple calibrator field IDs</h3>

<p>Multiple field IDs can be specified by writing a comma-separated list to your config file. However, this use case is not supported, since tasks such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">setjy</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">qufromgain</code> cannot handle this.</p>

<h1 id="restarting-or-using-part-of-the-pipeline">Restarting or Using Part of the Pipeline</h1>

<p>There are a few steps within the pipeline that only need to be run once for a given dataset. For datasets that have already been through the default pipeline, the reference antenna and list of bad antennas would have been calculated, and can be found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">logs/calc_refant-*.err</code>. These can be written in your new config file, where you also set <code class="highlighter-rouge">calcrefant=False</code>.</p>

<p>More generally, users can run any selected parts of the pipeline by editing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scripts</code> argument or passing scripts in via the command-line arguments (see <a href="/docs/processMeerKAT/using-the-pipeline#inserting-your-own-scripts">Using the Pipeline</a>).</p>

<p>The pipeline is not designed to run twice within the same directory, since CASA will complain the files already exist. The pipeline can be killed and re-run from the start at any point, but care should also be taken to ensure the data are not corrupted (e.g. during flagging or solving).</p>
