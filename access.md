title: Access to IDIA Machines
permalink: /access/
---

This page provides details on how to get access to the IDIA virtual machines. While this page is
specific to the IDIA-Pipelines project, the details related to requesting access and connecting to a
machine are identical. 

You can request access using the following [form][access].

In particular, please mention the team that you are a part of when you request access. This is
extremely important, since it will help us provide you with access to the relevant project files.

# Joining the IDIA Pipelines Team
Access to the IDIA-Pipeline resources can be arranged if you are part of the **Pipelines** Team.
Please contact Bradley Frank ([bradley@idia.ac.za][brad]) if you are interested in joining.

[Documentation][idia-pipelines] and [wiki][idia-pipelines-wiki] access are provided through a GitHub
project, so please sign-up to GitHub (if you haven't already) and join the [IDIA
Pipelines][idia-pipelines] repo as a contributor.

# Access

There are a pool of IDIA machines that are available for usage. Please note that the machine names
mentioned here are meant for usage by the IDIA-Pipelines team. In practice, we will provide you with
a machine name after you've requested access. 

You can access IDIA machines via a Jupyter-Hub (preferred) or SSH (traditional). 

The URL usually corresponds to the name of the VM, and is served on the IDIA domain. For example,
our **helo** node can be accessed via [https://helo.idia.ac.za][helo].

### Jupyter-Hub
A Virtual Machine (VM) can be accessed online using your browser (Chrome/Firefox preferred). Simply
type in the URL provided.

You will be presented with a login window for the Jupyter-Hub. Use your previously generated (LDAP)
username and password to access your account.

### SSH
To `SSH` into an IDIA VM, you will need your SSH key. 

This is how you would `SSH` into **helo** with X-forwarding:
````bash
$ ssh  -XY -i /path/to/your/key.pem helo.idia.ac.za -l <username>
````

# Changing your Password
You need to change your generic password as soon as possible. You can do this with the following
command (one line on the prompt):

`$ ldappasswd -H ldap://10.102.4.109 -x -D "cn=username,ou=users,dc=idia,dc=arc,dc=ac,dc=za" -W -S -A`

*Important:* In the command above, you will need to change `username` to your _username_.

You will then be prompted for passwords as follows:
* Twice for your current password (verification).
* Twice for your new password. 
* Once for your _LDAP_ password, which will be your *old* password. This is required to bind to the
  LDAP server to commit the change to your password. 

This is a little more involved then usual, because your credentials are not specific to a machine.
Access on the cloud is coordinated on using the LDAP server -- this is why you need to do the
_authenticate -> enter new password -> authorize/bind_ process to propagate your password to the
server. This allows us to provide you with access to any machine provisioned for your project
without having to remember a myriad of passwords. 

Incidentally, you can do this without ssh'ing into the machine -- simply open up a terminal using
the Jupyter-Hub and use this to change your password.

# Storage
There are several storage areas available. Most (all) Pipelines machines will have the IDIA storage
attached. This means that you will have access to your work and your data on any system that you're
logged into. 

Access to data is managed with Unix groups. 

Please take careful note of the following.

* `/users/<username>/`, where `/users` is a shared BeeGFS volume.
* `/data/users/<username>/`, where `/data` is a shared BeeGFS volume. This is the preferred space
  for you to store your longish term data products.
* `/data/<Project>` is a shared directory on BeeGFS for a project. You can fetch raw data from here.
  Please steer away from dumping data into this directory.
* `/scratch/users/<username>/` is the shared working directory for <username>, where `/scratch` is a
  BeeGFS volume). This is the preferred space for intermediate data products, e.g., you can use this
  space to do imaging.

# Setting up your own VM. 
Smaller VMs can be spun-up for (sub)-projects. Additionally, users will have to follow the
aforementioned process to setup their accounts.

Please use the Google form to design and [Request a VM][request-vm].

# GitHub
There are two important GitHub resources that project members can use:
* [IDIA-Pipelines Blog][idia-pipelines]: This is the repo for this website, and there is an
  associated [wiki][idia-pipelines-wiki] for project members to share information. 
* [IDIA Containers][idia-containers]: This is very important repository for the
  [Singularity][singularity] containers used at IDIA.
