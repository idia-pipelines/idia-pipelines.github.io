<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">processMeerKAT</code> software has been written to do calibration and imaging of MeerKAT
interferometric data.</p>

<p>Typical calibration and imaging of radio data comprises three steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial or <em>a priori</em> calibration, which involves bootstrapping phase and flux gains from observations of
reference calibrators.</li>
  <li>Self-calibration or <em>a posterioriâ€™</em> calibration, where the residual on-target errors are solved for
by (iteratively) building a good representation of the field.</li>
  <li>3rd Generation Calibration (3GC), aka post-selfcal, which deals with higher-order effects in the
pursuit of high dynamic range imaging. This includes compensating for the primary beam and
direction dependent effects.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">processMeerKAT</code> currently does full-polarisation <em>a priori</em> calibration on MeerKAT data, and includes automated
flagging. <code class="highlighter-rouge">processMeerKAT</code> is written solely for the processing of data on the ilifu SLURM cluster, but
future revisions will allow you to run the software on any HPC platform.</p>

<p>The main features of <code class="highlighter-rouge">processMeerKAT</code> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is written in Python 2.7 (for CASA 5.X).</li>
  <li>Calibration algorithms only use CASA 5.X tasks and helper functions.</li>
  <li>Uses a purpose-built CASA Singularity container for parallel processing at IDIA, i.e, is fully
thread-safe.</li>
  <li>Uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">MPICASA</code> to run parallel jobs over the cluster.</li>
  <li>Generates <code class="highlighter-rouge">SBATCH</code> files and ancillary helper scripts for processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read the documentation to learn how to use the pipeline for your imaging data at IDIA.</p>
